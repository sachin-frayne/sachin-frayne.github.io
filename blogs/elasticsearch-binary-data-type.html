      <p>
        The <code>binary</code> field type is the same as the
        <code>keyword</code> field type if you switch off the
        <code>inverted-index</code> and the <code>doc_values</code>, so then
        what is its purpose?
      </p>
      <p>
        A typical use case for Elasticsearch is as a Metadata Search Engine,
        with at least one of the fields in a document pointing to an object in
        another repository, such as links to images, films and songs, while the
        rest of the fields are used to locate that object, (song name, image
        description, director). To get the object itself you first need to
        search in Elasticsearch and then run a GET request in the other
        location. With the <code>binary</code> field type we can store the
        object directly in a field in Elasticsearch, now the query to
        Elasticsearch will bring back the <code>binary</code> object, there is
        no need to run a second request anywhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is great if you want to store the data in one place and you care
        about the information retrieval being as fast as possible.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Note: <code>binary</code> objects can be very large and will increase
        storage costs in Elasticsearch.
      </blockquote>
      <h3>Potentially useful use cases:</h3>
      <p>
        Files that are a few bytes or kilobytes in size, maybe even a few
        megabytes, like images, (png, jpg), short mp3s, static HTML pages, other
        documents, (txt/pdf/doc). These should also all be static files that are
        not going to be changed too frequently over time.
      </p>
      <h3>Use cases to avoid:</h3>
      <p>
        Large files, like videos, lossless songs, very large images, and so on,
        this list should include any files that are frequently updated like
        living documents in Google Docs/Microsoft Word or any other files
        created in collaboration or otherwise. (Frequently is difficult to
        define and it depends on the use case, as a rule of thumb if the file is
        changed 100s of times a day/week/month it is probably one to avoid).
